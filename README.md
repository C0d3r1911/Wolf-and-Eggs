# WolfandEggs
This is a JavaScript game from my early childhood. It gave me lots of fun during one summer break in the 90s.

When I started to learn JavaScript, I knew that not matter what I will recreate this game with my new "powers" (to have fun again). Today I am not child, so - unfortunately - couching eggs is not that exciting anymore :), but it was fun to make this game anyway.
